 <summary><h3>Hi there, I'm Giorgio üëãüèªüë®üèª‚Äçüíª</h3></summary>
Welcome to my digital diary where I share my transformative journey in the tech world! üåü In 2019 I took the bold leap to switch careers, diving headfirst into the ever-evolving ocean of coding. It all began with the basics - HTML and CSS - the building blocks of the web. But as I explored deeper, I discovered a fiery passion for mobile development, particularly in the realms of iOS and Flutter.

My path in coding is more than a profession; it's a daily adventure filled with creativity and endless possibilities. Each day is a new canvas, and I'm the artist sketching out innovative app ideas that pop into my mind. üöÄüì±

Currently, I'm navigating the exciting waters of game development with Flame, a game engine for Flutter. It's a journey of challenges and triumphs, and I'm thrilled to see where this new skill takes me.
